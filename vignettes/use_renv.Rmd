`create_renv_for_dev()` and `create_renv_for_prod()` function create `renv.lock` file based on developpement project.

# Create reproducible environments for your R projects with {renv}

Tool to create and maintain "renv.lock" files.
The idea is to have 2 distinct files, one for development and the other for deployment.
Indeed, although package like {attachment} or {pkgload} must be installed to develop, they are not necessary in your package/application.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
create_renv_for_dev()
create_renv_for_dev(dev_pkg = "attachment")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
create_renv_for_prod
```

# attachment <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

The goal of attachment is to help to deal with package dependencies
during package development. It also gives useful tools to install or
list missing packages used inside Rscripts or Rmds.

When building a package, we have to add `@importFrom` in our
documentation or `pkg::fun` in the R code. The most important is not to
forget to add the list of dependencies in the ‚ÄúImports‚Äù or ‚ÄúSuggests‚Äù
package lists in the DESCRIPTION file.

Why do you have to repeat twice the same thing ?  
And what happens when you remove a dependency for one of your functions
? Do you really want to run a ‚ÄúFind in files‚Äù to verify that you do not
need this package anymore ?

Let {attachment} help you ! This reads your NAMESPACE, your functions in
R directory and your vignettes, then update the DESCRIPTION file
accordingly. Are you ready to be lazy ?

See full documentation realized using {pkgdown} at
<https://thinkr-open.github.io/attachment/>

## Installation

CRAN version

``` r
install.packages("attachment")
```

Development version

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ThinkR-open/attachment")
```

## Use package {attachment}

### During package development

``` r
library(attachment)
```

What you really want is to fill and update your description file along
with the modifications of your documentation. Indeed, only the following
function will really be called. Use and abuse during the development of
your package !

``` r
attachment::att_amend_desc()
```

As {pkgdown} and {covr} are not listed in any script in your package, a
common call for your development packages would be:

``` r
attachment::att_amend_desc(extra.suggests = c("pkgdown", "covr"))
```

If you would like to add dependencies in the ‚ÄúRemotes‚Äù field of your
DESCRIPTION file, to mimic your local installation, you will want to
use:

``` r
attachment::set_remotes_to_desc()
```

#### Example on a fake package

``` r
# Copy package in a temporary directory
tmpdir <- tempfile(pattern = "fakepkg")
dir.create(tmpdir)
file.copy(system.file("dummypackage",package = "attachment"), tmpdir, recursive = TRUE)
#> [1] TRUE
dummypackage <- file.path(tmpdir, "dummypackage")
# browseURL(dummypackage)

# Fill the DESCRIPTION file automatically
desc_file <- attachment::att_amend_desc(path = dummypackage, inside_rmd = TRUE)
#> Updating dummypackage documentation

```

#### More on finding Remotes repositories (non installed from CRAN)

Find packages installed out of CRAN. This helps fill the ‚ÄúRemotes‚Äù field
in DESCRIPTION file with `set_remotes_to_desc()`.  
Behind the scene, it uses `fund_remotes()`.

- See the examples below if {fusen} is installed from GitHub
  - Also works for GitLab, Bioconductor, Git, Local installations

``` r
# From GitHub
remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/fusen",
                        quiet = TRUE, upgrade = "never")
attachment::find_remotes("fusen")
#> $fusen
#> [1] "ThinkR-open/fusen"
```

### For installation

To quickly install missing packages from a DESCRIPTION file, use:

``` r
attachment::install_from_description()
#> All required packages are installed
```

To quickly install missing packages needed to compile Rmd files or run
Rscripts, use:

``` r
attachment::att_from_rmds(path = ".") %>% attachment::install_if_missing()

attachment::att_from_rscripts(path = ".") %>% attachment::install_if_missing()
```

Function `attachment::create_dependencies_file()` will create a
`dependencies.R` file in `inst/` directory. This R script contains the
procedure to quickly install missing dependencies:

``` r
# No Remotes ----
# remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/fcuk")
# Attachments ----
to_install <- c("covr", "desc", "devtools", "glue", "knitr", "magrittr", "rmarkdown", "stats", "stringr", "testthat", "utils")
for (i in to_install) {
  message(paste("looking for ", i))
  if (!requireNamespace(i)) {
    message(paste("     installing", i))
    install.packages(i)
  }
}
```

### For bookdown, pagedown, quarto

If you write a {bookdown} and want to publish it on Github using GitHub
Actions or GitLab CI for instance, you will need a DESCRIPTION file with
list of dependencies just like for a package. In this case, you can use
the function to description from import/suggest:
`att_to_desc_from_is()`.

``` r
usethis::use_description()
# bookdown Imports are in Rmds
imports <- c("bookdown", attachment::att_from_rmds("."))
attachment::att_to_desc_from_is(path.d = "DESCRIPTION",
                                imports = imports, suggests = NULL)
```

Then, install dependencies with

``` r
remotes::install_deps()
```

### To list information

Of course, you can also use {attachment} out of a package to list all
package dependencies of R scripts using `att_from_rscripts()` or Rmd/qmd
files using `att_from_rmds()`.  
If you are running this inside a Rmd, you may need parameter
`inside_rmd = TRUE`.

``` r
dummypackage <- system.file("dummypackage", package = "attachment")

att_from_rscripts(path = dummypackage)
#> [1] "stats"        "testthat"     "dummypackage"
att_from_rmds(path = file.path(dummypackage, "vignettes"), inside_rmd = TRUE)
#> [1] "knitr"     "rmarkdown" "glue"
```

## Vignettes

Package {attachment} has vignettes to present the different functions
available. There is also a recommendation to have a `dev_history.R` in
the root directory of your package. (*Have a look at
[dev_history.R](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/attachment/blob/main/dev/dev_history.R)
in the present package*)

``` r
vignette("a-fill-pkg-description", package = "attachment")
vignette("b-bookdown-and-scripts", package = "attachment")
vignette("use_renv", package = "attachment")
```

The vignettes are available on the {pkgdown} page, in the ‚ÄúArticles‚Äù
menu: <https://thinkr-open.github.io/attachment/>

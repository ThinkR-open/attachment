\title{Save all documents in an active IDE session.}
\usage{
save_all()
}
\description{
Helper function wrapping IDE-specific calls to save all documents in the
active session. In this form, callers of `save_all()` don't need to
execute any IDE-specific code. This function can be extended to include
other IDE implementations of their equivalent
`rstudioapi::documentSaveAll()` methods.

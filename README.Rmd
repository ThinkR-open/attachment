# attachment

The goal of attachment is to help to deal with package dependencies during package development. It also gives useful tools to install or list missing packages used inside Rscripts or Rmds.
  
When building a package, we have to add `@importFrom` in our documentation or `pkg::fun` in the R code. The most important is not to forget to add the list of dependencies in the "Imports" or "Suggests" package lists in the DESCRIPTION file.  

Why do you have to repeat twice the same thing ?    
And what happens when you remove a dependency for one of your functions ? Do you really want to run a "Find in files" to verify that you do not need this package anymore ?    

Let {attachment} help you ! This reads your NAMESPACE, your functions in R directory and your vignettes, then update the DESCRIPTION file accordingly. Are you ready to be lazy ?

See full documentation realized using {pkgdown} at <https://thinkr-open.github.io/attachment/>  

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ThinkR-open/attachment")
```

## Use package {attachment}
### During package development
```{r}
library(attachment)
```

What you really want is to fill and update your description file along with the modifications of your documentation. Indeed, only the following function will really be called. Use and abuse during the development of your package !

```{r, eval=FALSE}
attachment::att_amend_desc()
```

As {pkgdown} and {covr} are not listed in any script in your package, a common call for your development packages would be:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
attachment::att_amend_desc(extra.suggests = c("pkgdown", "covr"))
```

_Note: `attachment::att_to_description()` still exists as an alias._

#### Example on a fake package

```{r}
# Copy package in a temporary directory
tmpdir <- tempdir()
file.copy(system.file("dummypackage",package = "attachment"), tmpdir, recursive = TRUE)
dummypackage <- file.path(tmpdir, "dummypackage")
# browseURL(dummypackage)
att_amend_desc(path = dummypackage)
```


### For installation
To quickly install missing packages from a DESCRIPTION file, use:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
attachment::install_from_description()
```

To quickly install missing packages needed to compile Rmd files or run Rscripts, use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
attachment::att_from_rmds(path = ".") %>% attachment::install_if_missing()

attachment::att_from_rscripts(path = ".") %>% attachment::install_if_missing()
```

Function `attachment::create_dependencies_file()` will create a `dependencies.R` file in `inst/` directory. This R script contains the procedure to quickly install missing dependencies:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# No Remotes ----
# remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/fcuk")
# Attachments ----
to_install <- c("covr", "desc", "devtools", "glue", "knitr", "magrittr", "rmarkdown", "stats", "stringr", "testthat", "utils")
for (i in to_install) {
  message(paste("looking for ", i))
  if (!requireNamespace(i)) {
    message(paste("     installing", i))
    install.packages(i)
  }
}
```

### For bookdown

If you write a {bookdown} and want to publish it on Github using Travis for instance, you will need a DESCRIPTION file with list of dependencies just like for a package. In this case, you can use the function to description from import/suggest: `att_to_desc_from_is()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# bookdown Imports are in Rmds
imports <- c("bookdown", attachment::att_from_rmds("."))
attachment::att_to_desc_from_is(path.d = "DESCRIPTION",
                                imports = imports, suggests = NULL)
```


### To list information
Of course, you can also use {attachment} out of a package to list all package dependencies of R scripts using `att_from_rscripts` or Rmd files using `att_from_rmds`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
dummypackage <- system.file("dummypackage", package = "attachment")

att_from_rscripts(path = dummypackage)
att_from_rmds(path = file.path(dummypackage,"vignettes"))
```

## Vignette

Package {attachment} has a vignette to present the different functions available. There is also a recommandation to have a `devstuff_history.R` in the root directory of your package. (*Have a look at [devstuff_history.R](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/attachment/blob/master/devstuff_history.R) in the present package*)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("fill-pkg-description", package = "attachment")
```

The vignette is available on the {pkgdown} page: <https://thinkr-open.github.io/attachment/articles/fill-pkg-description.html>
